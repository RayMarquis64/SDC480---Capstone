To run the application in its current version, I recommend running it from VS Code and using the terminal.

Requirements
	
	Python
	SQLite3
	openpyxl (Not implemented)
	
When in the terminal use
	pip install openpyxl (important for when I figure out and upload the export capabilities)
	
	then run

	python project_pricer.py 

	The window is expandable, If you cannot see features you are expecting to see, expand the window. 

Continuing support will include a windows build file that will convert the application into an executable. 

Excel export still not implemented currently
No current DB redundancy
Material quantity calculations not currently implemented properly, calculate material cost separately.
